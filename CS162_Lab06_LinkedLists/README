The program can be compiled by typing “make all” in the directory containing the uncompressed files from the rosatig.zip archive and an executable file named “prog” will be created in the same directory. 

Make will look for and compile the following files:
main.cpp
singleNode.hpp
singleNode.cpp
doubleNode.hpp
doubleNode.cpp 

Type "make clean" to remove the prog file.


Notes on testing:
I compiled and ran the program on FLIP, testing both the 
stack and the queue lists:

- attempt to display an empty list
- display a list with one or more nodes
- repeatedly add a node to both an empty list and a list with one 
or more nodes
- repeatedly delete a node to both an empty list and a list with one 
or more nodes
-  attempt to delete a node from an empty list

All functions worked as they were intended.
